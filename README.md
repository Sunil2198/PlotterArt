Processing sketches for plotter and laser engraver art

A repository for a bunch of Processing sketches that I've created. I tend to like xlean geometric and symmetrical shapes but with a bit of smooth randomness added in for visual interest. So, most of these sketches will follow those themes. I don't have a plotter (yet) so none of these has actually been 'tested' - do with that as you will. 

Thanks for stopping by!
